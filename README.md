# SpriteKitDemo
iOS game using Sprite Kit - Objective-C, Xcode Project

The game is played by tapping blocks to remove them from the screne.  Blocks can only be removed when adjacent blocks are the same color.  Game uses the framework provided by the SpriteKitDemo project for Xcode.  My instructor demostrated how to setup a scene, create the blocks using nodes, and add physics.  I created the logic for populating the scene with blocks, tacking where the blocks are on the scene, testing the color of adjacent blocks, removing blocks, adding new blocks, scoring system, reset button and logic, and title screne.
